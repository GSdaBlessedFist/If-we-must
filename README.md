# If We Must
## tax allocator

**Optimize tax impact!** This project aims, not at being the final solution, but rather, a visualization of what it could look like if we as taxpayers were able to allocate our taxes. 

The "_If We Must_" app addresses the common sentiment/complaint shared by millions of Americans concerned about our taxes going to undisclosed, un-democratically chosen, frankly, uncontrolled causes.  Being able to allocate where the money goes would go a long way towards transparency and strengthening confidence in government spending.
